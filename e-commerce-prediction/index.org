Since the variable =CustomerSupport= does not exit in the test data, I will exclude it when building models.

* Fit models
Due to the size of the dataset and the computationally intensive hyper-parameter tunning process, I use H2O distributed computing frame to fit models on high performance cluster(HPC). 

The models I will use include Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). 
** Prepare data 
*** A function to do data munging
Feature Engineering:
1) Including all dates will add too many dimensions.
2) Count the number of occurrences of each activity and the total number of activities for each user.
3) Test data don't have the variable =Customer Support=, exclude it to avoid data leakage.
4) Weighing each user_id's activity relative to the total number of activities within dataset.
5) Days between last activity and last date of the dataset.
6) Days between the first date and the last date of each activity for each user.

Form the three models above, we can see the error rate does not change too much between the models. I chose to include all the engineered features since the ensemble methods are robust against over-fitting and multicollinearity. However, there are a few more things I can try to further improve the model's performance:
 - More careful feature engineering.
 - Instead of dichotomizing the 'Purchase', group 'Purchase' and treat it as a multinomial variable.
 - Try to address the problem of imbalanced data.

** Gradient Boosting Model (GBM)

Here, I explore another ensemble method GBM since it is often one of the best performers. Unlike Random Forest, GBM requires carefully hyper-parameter tunning. The tree depth is almost always the most important hyper-parameter, so I first find a range of depth that yields good performance of GBM,  and then I do a grid search for the other hyper-parameters. Note, due to the heavy computation, I do not do cross-validation, but rather splitting the data into thee subsets: train, validation, test. This may increase the variance of estimates for the error rates.

*** Search the range of hyper-parameter =max_depth= that yields good performance of GBM.

The error rate of the winning GBM is lower than the error rate of RF, which indicates the grid search is successful.

*** Model Inspection and Final Test Set Scoring
Let's see how well the best model of the grid search (as determined by validation set AUC) does on the held out test set:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output :session :eval no
gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[1]])
h2o.auc(h2o.performance(gbm, newdata = test))
#+END_SRC

AUC on the held out date  is =0.924=.

Now we can investigate if these parameters are generalizable, by building a GBM model on the whole dataset (instead of the 60%) and using internal 5-fold cross-validation (re-using all other parameters including the seed):
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output :session :eval no
model <- do.call(
    h2o.gbm,
    ## update parameters in place
    {
        p <- gbm@parameters
        p$model_id = NULL          ## do not overwrite the original grid model
        p$training_frame = train      ## use the full dataset
        p$validation_frame = NULL  ## no validation frame
        p$nfolds = 5               ## cross-validation
        p
    }

*** Ensembling Techniques

To further reduce the variance of models, I use ensembling techniques by
simply taking the average of the predictions (purchase probabilities) of the top =k= grid search model predictions (here, I use k=5):

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code  :results output :session
dat_test_final <- h2o.importFile(
    path=normalizePath('./Data/test-wide.tsv'))

prob = NULL
k=5
for (i in 1:k) {
  gbm <- h2o.getModel(sortedGrid@model_ids[[i]])
  if (is.null(prob)) prob = h2o.predict(gbm, dat_test_final)$Y
  else prob = prob + h2o.predict(gbm, dat_test_final)$Y
}
prob <- prob/k

as.tibble(h2o.cbind(dat_test_final$ID, prob))%>%
    arrange(desc(Y)) %>%
    head(1000) %>%
    select(ID) %>%
    write.table(.,file = './Results/user_id_1000.txt',
                sep = '\n', quote = F, col.names = F,
                row.names = F)

* Most predictive features
Both Random Forest and GBM suggest that the most predictive variable is =EmailOpen=, which seems counter intuitive to me since =EmailOpen= demands little effort of a user. Possible reasons that can obfuscate the inference might include the disproportionately high abundance of =EmailOpen= activity and the highly correlated features.

* Recurrent neural network (RNN)
Predicting future consumer behavior is fundamental to many cases in e-commerce. Consumer behavior in e-commerce can be described by sequences of interactions with a webshop. The methods I employed above are vector-based methods; they operate on feature vectors of fixed length as input. To apply them to predict consumer behavior, one needs to convert consumer histories into fixed sets of features. These features need to be hand-crafted to reflect consumer behavior. Two major drawbacks of the vector-based methods are:
  1) Feature engineering requires domain knowledge and is very time consuming. These features often need to be constantly updated while more data are being collected.
  2) Consequently, lack of good engineered features can lead to poor predications.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a natural fit for modeling and predicting consumer behavior. RNN operate directly on sequences of data and thus are a perfect fit for modeling consumer histories. Time-intensive human feature engineering is no longer required. In addition, long short-term memory cells (LSTMs) can be used as a component of RNN, and LSTMs are good at preserving long-term dependencies.  

I tried to implement RNN to solve this take-home problem. However, I realized it might take substantially more time and effort. By researching 6sense's website, it seems this take-home problem is a good representation of the problems being solved at 6sense. I would love to learn more on how data scientist at 6sense solve those problems and the potential applications of RNN.
