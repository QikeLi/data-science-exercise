* A few thoughts
** Overview
*** Objectives
Given a few categorical and numerical variables, predict the delivery time.
*** Datasets
- historical data
- test data
*** My approach
Due to time constraints, in this exercise, I don't strive for the best performing model but rather to demonstrate how I approach a data science problem. In other words, no attempts were made in carefully tuning the models. Heavy model tuning often lead to only incremental increase of model accuracy. Whereas, substantial accuracy gain are often resulted from better understanding of the problem, identifying the right features to collect, and designing models to represent the special structure/characteristics in data.  
** Challenges
*** Missing values
    In the historical dataset, some variables have missing values. Note, throughout this report I use variables and features interchangeably. 
**** =total_onshift_dashers=, =total_busy_dashers=, and =total_outstanding_orders=    
     These variables represent market features. Since the market feature of the same time, i.e. the same hour of the same day of week, should be reasonably consistent. To impute the missing values, I took the average of these variables from the same time.
**** =estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration=
 This is the estimated travel time between store and consumer. Stores located at areas with heavy traffic may tend to have longer driving duration time, and vice versa. Therefore, I used the average of driving duration time of a store to fill in the missing driving duration times of the same store. Note, this may not be a good strategy to fill in the missing values since the driving time should also depend on the distance from a customer to a store. To determine the approach of engineering this feature, model performances should be compared between with and without imputing this variable.
**** =store_primary_category=
     A store often offers one type of cuisine. Therefore, for each store, I take its most frequent category to fill in the missing values.
**** =market_id= and =order_protocol=
     Instead of imputing the missing values for these two variables, I chose to treat the missing values as an extra level of the categorical variables since the their possible values cannot be inferred from the other variables. 
*** Feature engineering
**** The cyclic nature of the feature =hour= 
     Hour of day is an ordinal cyclic variables. It is inappropriate to treat this variable as numeric or ordinal.
     
     Delivery time heavily depends on the hour of day, and =hour= should definitely be included as a feature. It is not ideal to treat hour as a numerical variable since delivery time at 1am should be similar to that at midnight (hour=24). If we treat =hour= as a numerical variable, we implicitly assume the delivery time at 1am should be much similar to the delivery time at 2am than to the delivery time at midnight.
     To take care of cyclicity, I did the following trigonometric transformation

 \begin{eqnarray*}
 x &=& \sin(2\pi\cdot hour/24)\\
 y &=& \cos(2\pi\cdot hour/24)
 \end{eqnarray*}

 After the transformation, the distance between 1am and 24:00 and the distance between 1am and 2am are the same. Hence, I replaced the variable =hour= by =x-hour= and =y-hour=.  Note, even with deep learning, which doesn't require intensive feature engineering, these features are not likely to automatically emerge.
 # #+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no 
#    xhr = function(hr) sin(2*pi*hr/24)
#    yhr = function(hr) cos(2*pi*hr/24)
#    plot(xhr(1:24),yhr(1:24),pch = '.', xlab= 'x-hour', ylab='y-hour')
#    text(xhr(1:24),yhr(1:24), labels = 1:24)
# #+END_SRC

**** Linear vs non-linear; additive vs. interactive
Linear assumption is inappropriate since the delivery time never linearly increase as the other variables (e.g. =week of day=) increase.

The additive assumption is also inappropriate since interactive effects, such as =week of day= and =hour=, clearly exist. 
 
**** Random effects
 Random effects models — also known as hierarchical models — allow us to ascribe distinct behaviors to different "clusters" of observations, e.g. markets (=market_id=) may each act in a unique way. Furthermore, these models allow us to infer these tendencies in a collaborative fashion: while each market/cluster is assumed to behave differently, their parameters can be learned by heeding to the behavior of the population at large.

Linear mixed effects model is a widely used model to incorporate the random effects. However, since this model is a linear model, we need to manually engineer the features to incorporate the non-linearity and interactions between features.  

Neural networks are powerful function approximators and seem particularly suitable in this case to avoid the explicit feature engineering. Therefore, I also explored random effects models with deep neural network basis functions. 

To my knowledge, there are no available algorithms to model the random effects while approximating basis functions by neural networks. Fortunately, Bayesian probabilistic models provide a nimble and expressive framework. [[http://www.edwardlib.org][Edward]] is a probabilistic programming library that enables easy implementation of Bayesian probabilistic/generative models. Moreover, Edward uses TensorFlow as backend and variational inference as the inference tool, which allows the implemented algorithms to scale to massive data. Given the time constraints, my initial attempt is only exploratory, and I didn't end up using this model for model serving.
    
* EDA 
** Add some features
  The delivery time may depend on which day of week and which hour of day. Therefore, I extracted week of day and hour of day from the variable =created_at=

** Automatic Machine Learnig (AutoML) 
    In recent years a number of AutoML have been developed. [[https://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/master/3888/docs-website/h2o-docs/automl.html][H2O]] offers an easy-to-use AutoML package. The AutoML tools significantly reduce the effort on model implementation when exploring different models. Data scientist just need to specify the models to be included, and then these models will be automatically tuned and evaluated. Keep in mind, AutoML is suitable for the initial model exploration but not for getting the best performing model. Once an appropriate model family is identified, further tuning is still required.

- Model comparison  

As indicated by the following table, the best performing model is an ensemble model. This is a stacked ensemble model. Its algorithm can be found [[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/sagmb.2007.6.issue-1/sagmb.2007.6.1.1309/sagmb.2007.6.1.1309.xml][here]]. In short, stacked ensemble learning is a class of algorithms that involves training a second-level “metalearner” to find the optimal combination of the base learners. Unlike bagging and boosting, the goal in stacking is to ensemble strong, diverse sets of learners together.
I will use =StackedEnsemble_BestOfFamily= as the model for servnig.

** Mixed effects model
 A generalized mixed effects model (GLMM) is represented as:

\begin{equation*}
g(\mu_{ij}) = x_{ij} \beta + z_{ij}b_i
\end{equation*} 
 where g(·) is a monotonic “link” function, x_{ij} is 1 × p, and z_{ij} is 1 × q, with β a p × 1 vector of fixed effects and b_i a q × 1 v ector of random effects
 
If we were to apply conventional GLMM, we would need to transform a vector of p
raw covariates X = (X_1, ..., X_p)^T in the following way

\begin{equation*}
  φ(X) = (φ_1(X), ..., φ_m(X))
\end{equation*}

Usually in conventional GLMM, $φ_j (X)$ are chosen /a priori/ in some way. But here we are concerned with learning an appropriate $φ_j (X)$ from data. If a deep multi-layer perceptron is used for transforming the covariates, then Z has the form


\begin{equation*}
f_L(W_L,f_{L-1}(W_{L-1},\cdots,f_1(W_1,X)\cdots))
\end{equation*}
which is often graphically represented by a network as in the following figure
[[./Figures/neural-net.png]]
 $L$ is the number of hidden layers in the network, $w=(W_1,...,W_L)$ is the set of weights

** Script for model serving  
For the neural network based mixed effects model, since it is implemented in tensorflow, it can be served via tf.serving. A few advantages of tf.serving are:

- Scales to massive data.
- Supports online learning.
- Supports batch training.

The script I will use for model serving is shown below. If I had more time, I would have built a [[https://www.docker.com/][docker]] container for portability.
